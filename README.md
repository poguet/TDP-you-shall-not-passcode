# TDP-you-shall-not-passcode

## DESCRIPTION 

This is a application that generates a randomized passcode with upper and lower case letters,numbers, and special characters based on what the user desires 

I liked the results of the application and that they are very helpful to the user when in need of higher security passwords

Java script has been a real challange to grasp for me completeing this challange gave me confidence in the skills I have learned
